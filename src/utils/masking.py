    Creates a random boolean mask of the same shape as X, with 0s at places where a feature should be masked.
    Args:
        X: (seq_length, feat_dim) numpy array of features corresponding to a single sample
        masking_ratio: proportion of seq_length to be masked. At each time step, will also be the proportion of
            feat_dim that will be masked on average
        lm: average length of masking subsequences (streaks of 0s). Used only when `distribution` is 'geometric'.
        mode: whether each variable should be masked separately ('separate'), or all variables at a certain positions
            should be masked concurrently ('concurrent')
        distribution: whether each mask sequence element is sampled independently at random, or whether
            sampling follows a markov chain (and thus is stateful), resulting in geometric distributions of
            masked squences of a desired mean length `lm`
